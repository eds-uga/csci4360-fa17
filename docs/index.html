										<h2>Welcome to Data Science II</h2>
										<p>Fall 2017 Rendition</p>
									</header>
									<p><strong>All course announcements will be made in the Slack chat.</strong></p>
									<p>Lectures are <strong>Tuesdays</strong> and <strong>Thursdays</strong> from <strong>11:00am - 12:15pm</strong>, and <strong>Wednesdays</strong> from <strong>11:15am - 12:05pm</strong>. All meetings are in <strong><a href="http://www.uga.edu/a-z/location/hardman-hall/" target="_blank">Hardman Hall</a>, Room 101</strong>.
									<p>Course assignments will use AutoLab. We will be using <strong>Python 3[.6+]</strong> for most assignments.</p>
									<p>There are <strong>no</strong> required textbooks for the course. Course materials will be linked from the <a href="#schedule">lecture schedule</a> and archived in the <a href="https://github.com/eds-uga/csci4360-fa17">GitHub repository</a>; other recommended texts will be cited.</p>
									<p>You are <strong>not</strong> expected to know any programming before taking this course, but you <strong>are</strong> expected to pick it up very quickly.</p>
									<p>You <strong>are</strong> expected to be familiar with probability theory, statistics, and <a href="http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jwlee/teaching/csci3360/syllabus.html">basic machine learning</a>.</p>

									<h3>Course Details</h3>
									<p>This is the beating heart of course expectations, policies, and schedules. If something isn't clear, please ask; claiming you didn't know is not an acceptable defense.</p>

									<ul class="feature-icons">

									<li class="fa-code">
									<h4>AutoLab</h4>
									<p>We are using <a href="http://www.autolabproject.com/">AutoLab</a> for assignment submission and autograding.</p>

									<p>Take note: AutoLab is run from an internal UGA server, and can therefore <strong>only be accessed from campus, or via VPN.</strong> AutoLab can be found at this link:</p>

									<p style="margin-left: 25px; font-family: Courier;"><a href="https://autolab.cs.uga.edu">autolab.cs.uga.edu</a></p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-slack">
									<h4>Slack</h4>

									<p>Slack is our primary method of communication. The email you receive from me to register on Slack will likely be the last email I will proactively send you. While you are welcome to email me, I receive dozens--sometimes hundreds--of emails each day. Slack cuts through the noise, making it much more likely I will respond to questions in the Slack chat. Plus, in Slack, you have your student colleagues who can probably help even more quickly.</p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-cubes">
									<h4>Grading</h4>
									<p>There will be five assignments, a required workshop for each student, a midterm exam, and a final project.</p>

									<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table>
										<tr>

									</table>
									</div>

									<p><strong>There is NO FINAL EXAM for this class.</strong></p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-code-fork">
									<h4>Assignments</h4>
									<p>There will be <strong>five</strong> assignments through the course. Each assignment will be released on <strong>Thursday mornings</strong>, and will be due by <strong>11:59:59pm two weeks later</strong>.</p>

									<p>Assignment are downloaded and submitted through AutoLab. Assignments not submitted through AutoLab will not be graded; <strong>do not email me your assignments.</strong> For every 24 hours an assignment is late, 25% will be deducted from the final grade.</p>

									<p>Because AutoLab incorporates an auto-grader, you need to <strong>follow directions precisely</strong> for how you design your code. If the auto-grader fails, it may not necessarily be due to a bug in your code, but rather that you did not adhere to the input/output design guidelines of the assignment.</p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-coffee">
									<h4>Workshops</h4>
									<p>Workshops are held most Wednesdays. Each student is <strong>required</strong> to organize and lead at least one workshop; students can pair up if needed.</p>

									<p>Workshops are meant to be an opportunity to dig into the nuts and bolts of topics we are covering in lecture by demonstrating working code and how these topics can be implemented in practice. This can take several forms--students are encouraged to be imaginative!</p>

									<p>Recommended workshop topics are posted below, but if you have a better idea you are welcome to run with it! You can demo a new Python package, show a better way of doing something from lecture, or even a live-coding session for how to solve a certain problem (though it should go without saying that you need to <em>practice</em> the live coding ahead of time).</p>

									<h4>Midterm</h4>
									<p>The midterm exam will be <strong>Tuesday, October 3</strong>. Expect a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding questions.</p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-users">
									<h4>Final Project</h4>
									<p>The final project is an opportunity for you to really flex your data science skills and tackle a project you're passionate about.</p>

									<p>You are encouraged to form teams of 2 or 3; while teams of 1 person are strongly discouraged, exceptions to the 2-3 person rule of thumb are permitted with justification.</p>

									<p>There are three components: the <strong>proposal</strong>, the <strong>presentation</strong>, and the <strong>deliverable</strong>. The proposal is a 1-2 page roadmap of your project, detailing how you plan to do it, any contingencies and outcomes you can surmise, and your teammates. The presentation is a 30-minute talk summarizing your problem, motivating your approach, and discussing your results. The deliverable is a two-parter: the first is your code, and the second is a 6-10 page <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS-style paper</a> on your project.</p>

									<p><strong>Graduate students</strong> (taking 6360) are <strong>required</strong> to also submit their papers to a journal or conference; the submission venue must be included in the project proposal. <strong>Undergraduate students</strong> (taking 4360) can do this for <strong>extra credit</strong>.</p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-thumbs-up">
									<h4>Final Exam</h4>
									<p>There isn't one! Hooray!</p>

									</li>

									<li class="fa-book">
									<h4>Recommended Textbooks</h4>
									<p>The course has no required textbook. However, there are several recommended textbooks that this course will draw on over the semester. Should you want more information on a topic, these would be good places to start.</p>

									<h4>"A Culture of Honesty"</h4>
									<p>Here's the short version: <strong>don't copy code from the internets or from your friends.</strong> Coding is like writing: everyone has their own style, and it's easily recognizable. As such, forgery and plagiarism is also easily sniffed out. Plus, there are tools that do this for us now (this is, after all, a data science class).</p>

									<p>If cheating is uncovered, I am obligated to report the incident, no questions asked.</p>

									<p>The <a href="https://ovpi.uga.edu/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy">UGA Academic Honesty Policy</a> is the final word on these matters. Lack of knowledge of these policies is not sufficient justification for violations. If in doubt, ask me.</p>
